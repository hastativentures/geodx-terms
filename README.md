Your data is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)

You maintain complete ownership and control of your information  
There is no risk of data breaches from our systems

Import your existing contacts into the GeoDX database  
Infer geographic locations based on phone number area codes

Prevent duplicate contact entries  

Permission ControlYou have full control over this permission:  

You can deny the permission and still use the app with manually entered contacts  
You can revoke access at any time through your device's Settings  
We only read contact data; we never modify your device's address book  

Data ProcessingWhen you import contacts, we process phone numbers to infer geographic location based on area codes. This processing happens entirely on your device and no data is sent to external services for this purpose.
